    Because so much depends upon the suppression of us, the erasure of us, the omission of us; because we are not made to scald, to starve, to stuff in closets; because we have our own lyrics to drop; because we inherit our mothers' immodest tales;

    Because our nests and nooks hold buttons, stones and string, pressed flowers, feathers; every rosebud, every bead, every tarnished charm, every scrap of paper nestled between rosaries, safety pins, and scapulars—there are always poems here;

    Because so much depends upon the blaming of us, for birthing too many babies, for birthing none at all; because the unruled pages of this body refuse to be marked and ripped in two; because we bind our own perfect spines;

    Because of the low hum soothing the lungs, thrum in the throat, buzz in the skull till the head is numb, the body is a chamber of echoing song; scars are stories, healed fractures are as well (this, of course, you've heard before), but not all scars are bodily;

    Because we are razor-tongued (this, of course, you've heard before); because we've been told since the beginning of time to hold the tongue lest we lose it; because we still recoil at tendered words; because we remember the water's lullaby;

    Because we are a nation of the wretched and the occupied; we reclaim our elders' taken tongues, cut, and burned; because our foremothers were taken, cut, and burned too; and so we offer words, verses to warm, a balm;

    Because so much depends upon white nonsense and white fragility, orientalists, white microaggression, white supremacists with their shotguns and tiki torches; because telling us we don't fucking belong is an old and tired story;

    Because our being, our breathing, our speaking were never guaranteed; because our father's bones rest in this land and we have grieved; no, I will never leave this place, and no, I will never leave him; because his roots, this land are also mine;

    Because so much depends upon vacuous speech, and so sometimes it is best to refrain from all human voice; because when we sit with ourselves, there is just air, just light, and this is how we will learn to listen—

    body:`
    she whispers desert trees, thorn-ridged, trickling yellow candles; roots spilling snakes’ blood
virgin of ribboned silk; virgin of gold filigree
one day’s walk westward, a crucifix of fisherman’s dinghy dimensions washes ashore
virgin adorned in robe of shark embryo and coconut husk
she fingers mollusks, wraps herself in sea vines
virgin of ocean voyage peril
she will herself born
virgin of mud brick ruins; virgin of sandstorm echoes
she is saint of commonplaces; saint of badlands
virgin of jade, camphor, porcelain; virgin of barter for ghosts
penitents, earthdivers of forgotten names praying skyward
virgin of scars blossomed from open veins of fire
she slips across the pacific’s rivers of pearldiving children
virgin of copper coins
she is bloodletting words, painting unlikeness
virgin of anachronism
children stained with berries and rust, their skeletons bend, arrow-tipped; smoke blurs eyes’ edges
virgin of mineral depletion; virgin of mercury
at other altitudes she remembers to breathe; a monument scraping cloud
virgin of tin deposits extracted from mountains
these are not divinations; there is goldleaf about her skin
virgin of naming and renaming places in between

    body:`
    The shirtless man by the ticket counter
  has already broken the gloom here, his crowd
    of two boys and the cashier with the Star of David
      gathered around and mouthing astonishment

as he tells the tale behind every scar.
  Yes, this one on the side was from the camp—
     he tells them not to be shy to ask—
       when he tripped into the ditch

on the run after stealing cigarettes,
  the one on the knuckle from punching the soldier
   in the bar, brave with whiskey, a decade after.
     Touch it, he snarls, jutting out his fist.

That split a real Nazi’s lip.
  In the rooms behind him, the voices lay low
    but touch is the rule, the extended families
      passing in fours and fives as tight

as at church or the carnival. Are they
  all survivors here, dazed and exhilarated
    by the fate that dropped them so far from blight?
      A father heads the line, shirt fat with muscles

and a single proud thumb pushing the stroller;
  the woman and girl hug sideways, then again,
     tight as dancers in a row. At each display,
       the time lines and the whispered assurances

reiterate that what is done is done.
  Pol Pot is dead, the children of Kampuchea
    reading again to go to college; Rwanda
       has forgiven itself and opened supermarkets;

the ghettos are demolished, the Cold War won.
  Sudan, they skip. For now, the beasts are gone.
    They face the new life, the one after the mending,
      after the last mistakes were made.

    It's easy to
fall in love
with the
grocery store boys—
the one with the
tiny coffee cup
sweatshirt, too-tight
pants & cotton shoes or
the impossibly pale
fish boy who smiles
when he says, I'm
from Alaska. Your
heart swelled,
stupid &
dreaming
of a boat
in arctic
waters,
stars,
dots
that
dot the
ocean floor, you
will read
him poems & he
will explain the code
in the constellation
until morning,
waking together,
hunting for
no fish, sailing
as you two do,
parallel
only to
each other,
listening to ice
melt
back
to water.

    I think he knows I’m alive, having come down
    The three steps of the back porch
    And given me a good once over. All afternoon
    He’s been moving back and forth,
    Gathering odd bits of walnut shells and twigs,
    While all about him the great fields tumble
    To the blades of the thresher. He’s lucky
    To be where he is, wild with all that happens.
    He’s lucky he’s not one of the shadows
    Living in the blond heart of the wheat.
    This autumn when trees bolt, dark with the fires
    Of starlight, he’ll curl among their roots,
    Wanting nothing but the slow burn of matter
    On which he fastens like a small, brown flame.

    I was formed inside the body
    of a woman who wanted me
    as she wanted her own life,
    allowed to drink the milk
    made only for me.
    I was given mother-love,
    its bounty and its cocoon
    of those first years without language.
    It is right to mourn the rocky hills
    of Crete where we walked, my small
    hand in hers for hours. The hidden
    beach where we swam naked
    then baked on the fine sand. Lazy
    afternoons in her lap, her thick
    hand stroking my curls.
    Her fingers have stiffened.
    Her eyes, the eyes of an animal in pain.
    I hold my mother
    against the woman she is.

    The first blood drawn      I drew:—
    clipped too close, the fragile bed

    of the baby's fingernail opened a new red
    song inside my throat. When I tell you

    I wept at so little loss    and fear
    bloomed inside this, I mean

    to say I discovered a sudden
    window for my waiting,

    for paring prayers—:      may what
    breaks rise and reach again.

    It's up the stairs to the right
around the corner
through the looking glass.
Or it's straight ahead
down the hall past
the water fountain.

A frayed rope will lie at your feet.
A looking glass foretells
how you are going to leave—
by a miserable slow slog,
a quick stroke or heart attack,
or driving off a precipice.

You're not so old as my friend
who made a list—
carburetor, condenser, radiator, starter motor—
the parts that aren't working.
April sun flits over the woodpile.
My occipital lobe aches,
but it is so small a thing.
